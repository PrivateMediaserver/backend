  # This value needs to match `window.location.origin` evaluated by
  # the User Agent during registration and authentication ceremonies.
  # Multiple origins can be used when needed. Using more than one will imply you MUST configure rp_id explicitely. If
  # you need your credentials to be bound to a single origin but you have more than one tenant, please see [our Advanced
  # Configuration section](https://github.com/cedarcode/webauthn-ruby/blob/master/docs/advanced_configuration.md)
  # instead of adding multiple origins.

  # When operating within iframes or embedded contexts, you may need to restrict
  # which top-level origins are permitted to host WebAuthn ceremonies.
  #
  # crossOrigin / topOrigin verification is DISABLED by default:
  #   config.verify_cross_origin = false
  #
  # When `verify_cross_origin` is false, any `crossOrigin` / `topOrigin` values reported by the browser
  #    are ignored. As a result, credentials created or used within a cross-origin iframe will be treated
  #    as valid.
  #
  # When `verify_cross_origin` is true, you can either:
  #
  # (A) Allow only specific top-level origins to embed your ceremony
  #     (each entry must match the browser-reported `topOrigin` during registration/authentication):
  #
  #     config.allowed_top_origins = ["https://app.example.com"]
  #
  # (B) Forbid ANY cross-origin iframe usage altogether
  #     (this rejects creation/authentication whenever `crossOrigin` is true):
  #
  #     config.allowed_top_origins = []
  #
  # Note: if `verify_cross_origin` is not enabled, any values set in `allowed_top_origins`
  # will be ignored.

  # Relying Party name for display purposes

  # Optionally configure a client timeout hint, in milliseconds.
  # This hint specifies how long the browser should wait for any
  # interaction with the user.
  # This hint may be overridden by the browser.
  # https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredentialcreationoptions-timeout
  # config.credential_options_timeout = 120_000

  # You can optionally specify a different Relying Party ID
  # (https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#relying-party-identifier)
  # if it differs from the default one.
  #
  # In this case the default would be "auth.example.com", but you can set it to
  # the suffix "example.com"
  #
  # config.rp_id = "example.com"

  # TODO: use some variable (environment variable or environment config)
  config.rp_id = "localhost"

  # Configure preferred binary-to-text encoding scheme. This should match the encoding scheme
  # used in your client-side (user agent) code before sending the credential to the server.
  # Supported values: `:base64url` (default), `:base64` or `false` to disable all encoding.
  #
  # config.encoding = :base64url

  # Possible values: "ES256", "ES384", "ES512", "PS256", "PS384", "PS512", "RS256", "RS384", "RS512", "RS1"
  # Default: ["ES256", "PS256", "RS256"]
